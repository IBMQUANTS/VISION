Because a mobile phone or a tablet's screen <br>is smaller than a regular computer screen, design, ergonomics, and <br>content 
all need to be shaped to the distinct characteristics of this media.<br> Therefore, a webpage that is visited from a computer 
would have a different<br> layout when visited from a mobile phone. This is why a mobile web page needs<br> to adapt to the format's 
limitations.<br><br>

<br> On top of this, a technical barrier exists. Internet connection on a <br>smartphone works via a 3G connection, 
which is a lot slower than a<br> traditional Internet connection. In order to avoid slow and frustrating usage,<br> a mobile web page's 
content needs to be as light as possible. Unitag's U.me tool<br> allows users to create their own mobile website, specifically adapted
to smart-<br>phones and tablets. Creating your own mobile website is made easy and fun!
